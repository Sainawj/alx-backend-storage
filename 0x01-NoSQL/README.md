## NoSQL & MongoDB

### NoSQL
NoSQL databases are non-relational and designed for flexible, large-scale data handling. Unlike SQL, NoSQL doesnâ€™t rely on a fixed schema, making it ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data. Common NoSQL types include:
- **Key-Value Stores** (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
- **Document Stores** (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB)
- **Column-Family Stores** (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
- **Graph Databases** (e.g., Neo4j)

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents and is ideal for dynamic, large-scale applications.

#### Key Features:
- **Document-Oriented:** Data stored in BSON (Binary JSON).
- **Scalable:** Supports horizontal scaling (sharding).
- **Indexing & Queries:** Dynamic ad-hoc queries and powerful indexing.
- **Replication:** High availability with replica sets.
- **Aggregation Framework:** For complex data processing.

MongoDB is widely used for real-time applications, content management, and IoT systems.
